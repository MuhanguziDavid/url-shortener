Developer Notes

Hi, I have implemented this URL Shortener in Express NodeJs with a Redis data store to store key-value pairs.
The reason for using Redis is that Redis is suitable for lightweight application such as this and Redis also has great execution time.
I used HandlebarsJs as a template engine since its syntax is easy to understand and it executes fast.

I took the assumption that the application will not need to store more than one URL at a time.
However, this can easily be changed to allow for may long and short urls to be stored at a time.

Here is how to install and run the application:
The following should be installed on your computer:
- node js
- Redis
- docker and docker-machine

Guiding steps
1. Clone the repo
2. In your terminal, cd into the project directory
3. Run `make setup` to install dependencies
4. Run `make server` to run the application in a containerized environment (docker)
5. Open `http://192.168.99.100:8080/` or `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser. You should see the STORD URL Shortener running.
6. After using the application, run `make stop` to stop the application.
7. Run `make test` to run tests.

How to use the URL Shortener
1. Once the application is open in your browser, you will see a simple form with a submit button.
2. Copy any long URL and paste it into the input field and click the submit button.
3. A short URL will be generated and you will be redirected to a page showing the short URL and a `Visit Site` button
4. Click the `Visit Site` button to get redirected to the long URL.
5. You could also copy the short URL and paste it in a browser window to be redirected to the site with a long URL.
6. The `Back to main page` button redirects to the home page for one to enter a new URL for shortening
7. If an unknown path is entered, one should be redirected to a page notifying them that the page does not exist.
